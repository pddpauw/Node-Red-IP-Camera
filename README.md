# Node-Red-IP-Camera
display IP camera images in the dashboard

I wanted to hava an easy way to show the images from my IP camera on the Node Red dashboard, before opening the gate.
I've tried several options to get the stream into the dashboard, but this resulted in unstable code and the rest of Node Red being slow.
The easiest and "good enough" version as to get images from the IP cam, and refresh them every 1 sec (for 30 sec).

You might have to enable this functionality in your IP camera before you can access the images.
